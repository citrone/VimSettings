These are my vim settings. Based on an article from vimcasts.org (see: http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/)
I decided that it's a good ideea to store my vim settings file and also the plugins I use in github. This allows me to use the same settings when I move
from one machine to another.

In order to make things work, assumming that you have a fresh install of vim the following should be done:
1) install the pathogen plugin
2) create a .vim folder in your home directory
3) clone this repository
4) make a symbolic lynk to ~/.vim/_vimrc in your home directory
